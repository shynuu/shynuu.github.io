I am a network researcher passionate about new technologies, the convergence of software, and virtualization with networking is the best today.

I love to think about the future of the internet, design new protocols, always keep up to date, and develop new networking technologies.

Currently working on 6G and Satellite Networks; both networks are impressive but more powerfully integrated! QKD is also nice, but they still require more work...

In my free time, I like contributing to projects that benefit the community and, of course, taking a hike.
